Nothing Interest , I am bored thats why i create this.  and the name of this project says it all




# What the heck is Javascript : 


<p>  Javascript is a dynamically typed , multi-paradigm , prototypical based , oop,  high level , interpreted asynchronus programming language which have Cross - platform capability , can be used in both server and client a Great programming Language I Loved </p>

Power of JS : 

    1. Dynamically Typed : JS facilliates flexible data manipulation by dynamically assigning data types during run time , 

    2 . Prototype-based inheritence : Objects in js inherit properties and behavior directly from other objects.

    3. Crose-platform - supported by all except Onion 

    4. Server side development - Easily server side accessible .





# Javascript - version :

    Achieve ECMA standard in 1997 and become ECMAscript , it has ES1 , ES2 , ES3 , ES5 , ES6

# Hoisting : 

    JavaScript Hoisting means that before executing the code, the interpreter moves the declarations of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope.


    // Hoisting includes ; function() , function* , async-function , async-function*

# Variable Naming Rules : 

    Use Descriptive names : Choose meaning full variable naming convension
    Like declaring a persons age : 

        let age = 25;
        const name = sakib;

    Use camel case for multiple word in variable , 

        let firstWord = 'Hello world' ;
    
    Avoid reserved word : 
        let let=5 // Here i use let as a variable name;
        
    Be consistent :

        consistent naming convention throughout the code base
    
    
    Use meaningful variable names : 

        Choose variable names according

    Avoid Single letter variable names (except in certain cases):
        Single letter variable names are legal but not accepted 

#Variable Scopes : 

    Variable scope refers to the region or context in the code where a variable is defined and can be accessed. 

        simple term :   where a variable is available to access in js code.


    Global Scope : 
        Variable declared outside of any function or block , They can be accesed from any where of the code.
    
    Block Scope : 
        Variables declared using let Const have block scope. 
        Block scope refers to any code block enclosed in braces ' {} ' such as loops. ( for , while ). Conditional statements ('if' , 'else') . Functional blocks
    
    Lexical Scope : 

        Static Scope , Lexical scope means that the accessibility of variables is determined by their location within the code when its written.
