# What the heck is Javascript : 


<p>  Javascript is a dynamically typed , multi-paradigm , prototypical based , oop,  high level , interpreted asynchronus programming language which have Cross - platform capability , can be used in both server and client a Great programming Language I Loved </p>

Power of JS : 

    1. Dynamically Typed : JS facilliates flexible data manipulation by dynamically assigning data types during run time , 

    2 . Prototype-based inheritence : Objects in js inherit properties and behavior directly from other objects.

    3. Crose-platform - supported by all except Onion 

    4. Server side development - Easily server side accessible .
